# Project--Week-4
The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:

* Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
* The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
